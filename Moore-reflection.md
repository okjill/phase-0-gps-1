## What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Git push and pull were still a bit of a mystery to me. I wasn't sure with what frequency you should do either, or which branch (master vs. feature) you should do it from.

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Getting more practice at each step of the Git workflow helped clarify when to push and pull. I also learned some new shortcuts: git co, git br, git add ., and git push/pull -u. 

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
1. In which instances would you fork a repository vs. cloning a repository?
2. How frequently should you do a git pull on your repository?
3. What's the difference between git pull and git fetch?

## What still confuses you about Git?
I need to dive in a bit more on pushing and pulling from the master vs. the feature branch. 

## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I have to say it was a bit awkward at first determining what level of detail to give as the navigator, and how much decision-making you could do as the driver. It felt a little unnatural at first, but I think we got into a better flow as the session went on. I thought Anca was a great partner and Sara was a great guide!
